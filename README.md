# GithubExplorer

GithubExplorer is a simple and small .NET 8 MAUI app, which allows you to browse the trending page on GitHub (github.com/trending), you can set a custom url in order to filter and only see specific repositories (like a specific language, country etc.).

## Features

Built using .NET 8 MAUI framework, using following open-source libraries and frameworks:

- [GithubDataNet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GithubDataNet)
- [MudBlazor](https://mudblazor.com)
- [MudBlazor.Markdown](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MudBlazor.Markdown)
- [NavigationManagerUtils](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NavigationManagerUtils)
- [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json)
- .NET MAUI and associated packages from Microsoft

## Installation

- I don't know if a normal installation is working with MAUI atm, I will upload the .app, .exe and other files to the releases.
- If not, just get the source, install MAUI (using "dotnet workload"), setup the project, build it and done.


## Functionality

- Simply scroll through all trending repositories:
    - Take a look at the ReadMe in-app
    - Load a few details (if they are available) like project topics, project url etc.
